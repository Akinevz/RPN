#ReversePolishParser

------
Simple reverse polish calculator that parses, tokenises and computes expressions in reverse polish notation.


Available operators: `*, /, +, -, ", ^, **, l, #, ~`


Everything operates on `DOUBLE`s


**TODO:** update code to make the character matching more functional like in recent projects.
